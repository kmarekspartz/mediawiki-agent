Before submitting your changes, please make sure to run all relevant tests,
linters, and type checkers to ensure code quality. If you're introducing new
functionality, remember to add corresponding tests; our goal is to maintain or
even improve test coverage with each contribution. When it comes to
dependencies, please avoid switching them. We prefer pytest for testing, so try
to avoid introducing unittest if possible. Also, aim to avoid mocks in your
tests whenever you can.

Familiarize yourself with the existing code style and strive to maintain
consistency throughout your contributions. Ensure your changes are focused on the
issue at hand and avoid unrelated modifications. If your changes affect
user-facing behavior or internal APIs, please update relevant documentation
accordingly.

Follow standard conventions for writing clear and informative commit messages. Be
mindful of potential performance impacts of your changes, especially for critical
code paths. Finally, we encourage writing readable code over relying on detailed
comments; clear code is often self-documenting.
